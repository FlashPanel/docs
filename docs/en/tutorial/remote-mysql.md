# Access MySQL remotely

In reality, you want to access `MySQL` | `MariaDB` from your computer to the server, or that server is `Remote Database` for everyone to use,...

## Method 1: Open port 3306 (not safe ðŸ‘€)

Opening database port 3306 is the fastest way to make a connection to the remote database, however this is the least secure way, because now port 3306 is public, anyone can access this port to test. Password detector, if you set a weak password, it will be easily attacked.

To open port 3306, see [instructions for using Firewall Rule](../server/firewall-rule.md)

## Method 2: Through SSH Tunnel (safe ðŸ‘‰ recommended)

First you need to do [create SSH Key](../knowledge/ssh-keys.md#create-ssh-key) and [add SSH Key to the server](../knowledge/ssh-keys.md# add-ssh-key-into-machine-chu)
